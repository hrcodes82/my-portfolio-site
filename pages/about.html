    <p> Helen Richards, a graduate of the University of Lincoln (UK) and qualified copywriter is an aspiring
        Front End Developer. She is currently studying with the online coding school Skillscrush and has 
        recently completed the first module on HTML and CSS, which enabled her to create this static 
        website.</p>

        <p>Helen looks forward to working through the rest of the course and learning additional technical skills
        including GIT and Github, Coding Responsive Websites, Javascript, React, Wordpress, Ruby. She will also be 
        learning about Visual Design, Branding, Web Design and Freelancing.</p>

        <p>She lives in the quaintly titled Black Country in the West Midlands, UK with her boyfriend,
        many books, several video games consoles and various games and far too many craft supplies which she
        has accumulated throughout the years.</p>

        <p>Helen is a bit of a scanner and has too many interests/hobbies. In her spare time she likes to read fantasy
           fiction, play video games, rock climb, cook, bake, write and generally try anything creative, 
           arty or crafty.</p>

        <p>A random fun fact is that in 2016 whilst on a climbing adventure in Greece, Helen was stranded on
            an island overnight with two friends after getting lost in the dark. This remains an excellant
            adventure story to tell friends and acquaintances alike! </p>
